Writing Workflows
=================

In Snakemake, workflows are specified as Snakefiles.
Inspired by GNU Make, a Snakefile contains rules that denote how to create output files from input files.
Dependencies between rules are handled implicitly, by matching filenames of input files against output files.
Thereby wildcards can be used to write general rules.



.. _snakefiles-depend_version:

Depend on a Minimum Snakemake Version
-------------------------------------

From Snakemake 3.2 on, if your workflow depends on a minimum Snakemake version, you can easily ensure that at least this version is installed via

.. code-block:: python

    from snakemake.utils import min_version

    min_version("3.2")

given that your minimum required version of Snakemake is 3.2. The statement will raise a WorkflowError (and therefore abort the workflow execution) if the version is not met.
