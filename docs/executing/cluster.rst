.. _cluster:

=================
Cluster Execution
=================

Snakemake can make use of cluster engines that support shell scripts and have access to a common filesystem, (e.g. Slurm or PBS).
There exists a generic cluster support which works with any such engine (see :ref:`cluster-generic`), and a specific support for Slurm (see :ref:`cluster-slurm`).
When executing on a cluster, Snakemake implicitly assumes some default resources for all rules (see :ref:`default-resources`).

.. _cluster-slurm:

--------------
Executing on SLURM clusters
--------------

`SLURM <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_ is a widely used batch system for
performance compute clusters. In order to use Snakemake with slurm, simply append ``--slurm`` to your Snakemake invocation.

Specifying Account and Partition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Most SLURM clusters have two mandatory resource indicators for accounting and scheduling, `Account` and `Partition`, respectivily.
These resources are usually omitted from Snakemake workflows in order to keep the workflow definition independent from the platform. 
However, it is also possible to specify them inside of the workflow as resources in the rule definition (see :ref:`snakefiles-resources`).

To specify them at the command line, define them as default resources:

.. code-block:: console

  $ snakemake --slurm --default-resources slurm_account=<your SLURM account> slurm_partition=<your SLURM partition>

If individual rules require e.g. a different partition, you can override the default per rule:

.. code-block:: console

  $ snakemake --slurm --default-resources slurm_account=<your SLURM account> slurm_partition=<your SLURM partition> --set-resources <somerule>:slurm_partition=<some other partition>

Usually, it is advisable to persist such settings via a :ref:`configuration profile <profiles>`, which can be provided system-wide or per user.

Ordinary SMP jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most jobs will be carried out by programs which are either single core scripts or threaded programs, hence SMP (`shared memory programs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory>`_)
in nature. Any given threads and ``mem_mb`` requirements will be passed to SLURM:

.. code-block:: python

  rule a:
      input: ...
      output: ...
      threads: 8
      resources:
          mem_mb=14000

This will give jobs from this rule 14GB of memory and 8 CPU cores.
It is advisable to use resonable default resources, such that you don't need to specify them for every rule.
Snakemake already has reasonable defaults built in, which are automatically activated when using the ``--default-resources`` flag (see above, and also ``snakemake --help``).

.. _cluster-slurm-mpi:

MPI jobs
~~~~~~~~

Snakemake's Slurm backend also supports MPI jobs, see :ref:`snakefiles-mpi` for details.
When using MPI with slurm, it is advisable to use ``srun`` as MPI starter.

.. code-block:: python

  rule calc_pi:
    output:
        "pi.calc",
    log:
        "logs/calc_pi.log",
    resources:
        tasks=10,
        mpi="srun",
    shell:
        "{resources.mpi} -n {resources.tasks} calc-pi-mpi > {output} 2> {log}"

Note that the ``-n {resources.tasks}`` is not necessary in case of SLURM, but it should be kept in order to allow execution of the workflow on other systems, e.g. by replacing ``srun`` with ``mpiexec``:

.. code-block:: console

  $ snakemake --set-resources calc_pi:mpi="mpiexec" ...

Advanced Resource Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A workflow rule may support a number of :ref:`resource <snakefiles-resources>` specification. For a SLURM cluster, 
a mapping between Snakemake and SLURM needs to be performed.

You can use the following specifications:

+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SLURM Resource       | Snakemake resource  |                      Background Information                      |
+============================+=====================+==================================================================+
| ``-p``/``--partition``     | ``slurm_partition`` | the partition a rule/job is to use                               |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-t``/``--time``          | ``runtime``         | the walltime per job in minutes                                  |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-C``/`--constraint`      | ``constraint``      | may hold features on some clusters                               |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``--mem``                  | ``mem_mb``          | memory in MB a cluster node must provide                         |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``--mem-per-cpu``          | ``mem_mb_per_cpu``  | memory per reserved CPU                                          |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-n``/``--ntasks``        | ``tasks``           | number of concurrent tasks / ranks                               |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-c``/``--cpus-per-task`` | ``cpus_per_task``   | number of cpus per task (in case of SMP, rather use ``threads``) |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-N``/``--nodes``         | ``nodes``           | number of nodes                                                  |
+----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Each of these can be part of a rule, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

  rule:
      input: ...
      output: ...
      resources:
          partition=<partition name>,
          runtime=<some number>

Please note: as ``--mem`` and ``--mem-per-cpu`` are mutually exclusive on SLURM clusters, there corresponding resource flags ``mem_mb`` and ``mem_mb_per_cpu`` are mutually exclusive, too.
You can only reserve memory a compute node has to provide or the memory required per CPU (SLURM does not make any distintion between real CPU cores and those provided by hyperthreads).
SLURM will try to sastify a combination of ``mem_mb_per_cpu`` and ``cpus_per_task`` and ``nodes``, if ``nodes`` is not given.

Note that it is usually advisable to avoid specifying SLURM (and compute infrastructure) specific resources (like ``constraint``) inside of your workflow because that can limit the reproducibility on other systems.
Consider using the ``--default-resources`` and ``--set-resources`` flags to define such resources on the command line.

Additional custom job configuration
```````````````````````````````````

SLURM installations can support custom plugins, which may add support for additional flags to ``sbatch``.
In addition, there are various ``sbatch`` options not directly supported via the resource definitions shown above.
You may use the ``slurm_extra`` resource to specify additional flags to ``sbatch``:

.. code-block:: python

  rule:
      input: ...
      output: ...
      resources:
          slurm_extra="--qos=long --mail-type=ALL --mail-user=<your email>"

.. _cluster-generic:

-----------------------
Generic cluster support
-----------------------

To use the generic cluster support, Snakemake simply needs to be given a submit command that accepts a shell script as first positional argument:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster qsub --jobs 32


Here, ``--jobs`` denotes the number of jobs submitted to the cluster at the same time (here 32).
The cluster command can be decorated with job specific information, e.g.

.. sidebar:: Note

  Consider to :ref:`group jobs <snakefiles-grouping>` in order to minimize overhead, in particular for short-running jobs.


.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub {threads}"

Thereby, all keywords of a rule are allowed (e.g. rulename, params, input, output, threads, priority, resources, ...).
For example, you could encode the expected running time in minutes into a :ref:`resource <snakefiles-resources>` ``runtime_min``:

.. code-block:: python

    rule:
        input:  
            ...
        output:
            ...
        resources: 
            runtime_min=240
        shell:
            ...

and forward it to the cluster scheduler:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub --runtime {resources.runtime}"

In order to avoid specifying ``runtime_min`` for each rule, you can make use of the ``--default-resources`` flag, see ``snakemake --help``.

If your cluster system supports `DRMAA <https://www.drmaa.org/>`_, Snakemake can make use of that to control jobs.
With DRMAA, no ``qsub`` command needs to be provided, but system specific arguments can still be given as a string, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --drmaa " -q username" -j 32

Note that the string has to contain a leading whitespace.
Else, the arguments will be interpreted as part of the normal Snakemake arguments, and execution will fail.

Adapting to a specific cluster can involve quite a lot of options. It is therefore a good idea to setup a :ref:`a profile <profiles>`.


Job Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Note

    If there are more than 100 input and/or output files for a job, ``None`` will be used instead of listing all values. This is to prevent the jobscript from becoming larger than `Slurm jobscript size limits <https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html#OPT_max_script_size=#>`_.

When executing a workflow on a cluster using the ``--cluster`` parameter (see below), Snakemake creates a job script for each job to execute. This script is then invoked using the provided cluster submission command (e.g. ``qsub``). Sometimes you want to provide a custom wrapper for the cluster submission command that decides about additional parameters. As this might be based on properties of the job, Snakemake stores the job properties (e.g. name, rulename, threads, input, output, params etc.) as JSON inside the job script (for group jobs, the rulename will be "GROUP", otherwise it will be the same as the job name). For convenience, there exists a parser function `snakemake.utils.read_job_properties` that can be used to access the properties. The following shows an example job submission wrapper:

.. code-block:: python

    #!python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import os
    import sys

    from snakemake.utils import read_job_properties

    jobscript = sys.argv[1]
    job_properties = read_job_properties(jobscript)

    # do something useful with the threads
    threads = job_properties[threads]

    # access property defined in the cluster configuration file (Snakemake >=3.6.0)
    job_properties["cluster"]["time"]

    os.system("qsub -t {threads} {script}".format(threads=threads, script=jobscript))
