Cluster Execution
=================


Snakemake can make use of cluster engines that support shell scripts and have access to a common filesystem, (e.g. the Sun Grid Engine).
In this case, Snakemake simply needs to be given a submit command that accepts a shell script as first positional argument:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster qsub -j 32


Here, ``-j`` denotes the number of jobs submitted to the cluster at the same time (here 32).
The cluster command can be decorated with job specific information, e.g.

.. sidebar:: Note

  Consider to :ref:`group jobs <snakefiles-grouping>` in order to minimize overhead, in particular for short-running jobs.


.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub {threads}"

Thereby, all keywords of a rule are allowed (e.g. rulename, params, input, output, threads, priority, resources, ...).
For example, you could encode the expected running time into resources:

.. code-block:: python

    rule:
        input:  
            ...
        output:
            ...
        resources: 
            runtime_min=240
        shell:
            ...

and forward it to the cluster scheduler:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub --runtime {resources.runtime}"

In order to avoid specifying ``runtime_min`` for each rule, you can make use of the ``--default-resources`` flag, see ``snakemake --help``.
If your cluster system supports `DRMAA <https://www.drmaa.org/>`_, Snakemake can make use of that to increase the control over jobs.
E.g. jobs can be cancelled upon pressing ``Ctrl+C``, which is not possible with the generic ``--cluster`` support.
With DRMAA, no ``qsub`` command needs to be provided, but system specific arguments can still be given as a string, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --drmaa " -q username" -j 32

Note that the string has to contain a leading whitespace.
Else, the arguments will be interpreted as part of the normal Snakemake arguments, and execution will fail.

Adapting to a specific cluster can involve quite a lot of options. It is therefore a good idea to setup a :ref:`a profile <profiles>`.

--------------
Job Properties
--------------

When executing a workflow on a cluster using the ``--cluster`` parameter (see below), Snakemake creates a job script for each job to execute. This script is then invoked using the provided cluster submission command (e.g. ``qsub``). Sometimes you want to provide a custom wrapper for the cluster submission command that decides about additional parameters. As this might be based on properties of the job, Snakemake stores the job properties (e.g. name, rulename, threads, input, output, params etc.) as JSON inside the job script (for group jobs, the rulename will be "GROUP", otherwise it will be the same as the job name). For convenience, there exists a parser function `snakemake.utils.read_job_properties` that can be used to access the properties. The following shows an example job submission wrapper:

.. code-block:: python

    #!python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import os
    import sys

    from snakemake.utils import read_job_properties

    jobscript = sys.argv[1]
    job_properties = read_job_properties(jobscript)

    # do something useful with the threads
    threads = job_properties[threads]

    # access property defined in the cluster configuration file (Snakemake >=3.6.0)
    job_properties["cluster"]["time"]

    os.system("qsub -t {threads} {script}".format(threads=threads, script=jobscript))
