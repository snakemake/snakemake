Requirements
::::::::::::

To go through this tutorial, you need the following software installed:

Run tutorial for free in the cloud via Gitpod
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. sidebar:: Note

    A common thing to happen while using the development environment in GitPod is to hit ``Ctrl-s`` while in the terminal window, because you wanted to save a file in the editor window.
    This will freeze up you terminal.
    To get it back, make sure you selected the terminal window by clicking on it and then hit ``Ctrl-q``.

The easiest way to run this tutorial is to use Gitpod, which enables performing the excercises via your browser---including all required software, for free and in the cloud.
In order to do this, simply open the predefined `snakemake-tutorial GitPod workspace <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-tutorial-data>`_ in your browser.
GitPod provides you with a `Theia development environment <https://theia-ide.org/docs>`_, which you can learn about in the linked documentation.
Once you have a basic understanding of this environment, you can go on directy with :ref:`tutorial-basics`.

Running the tutorial on your local machine
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If you prefer to run the tutorial on your local machine, please follow the steps below.

The easiest way to set these prerequisites up, is to use the Mambaforge_ Python 3 distribution 
(Mambaforge_ is a Conda based distribution like Miniconda_, which however uses Mamba_ a fast and more robust replacement for the Conda_ package manager).
The tutorial assumes that you are using either Linux or MacOS X.
Both Snakemake and Mambaforge_ work also under Windows, but the Windows shell is too different to be able to provide generic examples.

Setup on Windows
::::::::::::::::

If you already use Linux or MacOS X, go on with **Step 1**.

Windows Subsystem for Linux
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you use Windows 10, you can set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (`WSL`_) to natively run linux applications.
Install the WSL following the instructions in the `WSL Documentation`_. You can chose any Linux distribution available for the WSL, but the most popular and accessible one is Ubuntu.
Start the WSL and set up your account; now, you can follow the steps of our tutorial from within your Linux environment in the WSL.

Vagrant virtual machine
"""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are using a version of Windows older than 10 or if you do not wish to install the WSL, you can instead setup a Linux virtual machine (VM) with Vagrant_.
First, install Vagrant following the installation instructions in the `Vagrant Documentation`_.
Then, create a new directory you want to share with your Linux VM, for example, create a folder named ``vagrant-linux`` somewhere.
Open a command line prompt, and change into that directory.
Here, you create a 64-bit Ubuntu Linux environment with

.. code:: console

    > vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
    > vagrant up

If you decide to use a 32-bit image, you will need to download the 32-bit version of Miniconda in the next step.
The contents of the ``vagrant-linux`` folder will be shared with the virtual machine that is set up by vagrant.
You can log into the virtual machine via

.. code:: console

    > vagrant ssh

If this command tells you to install an SSH client, you can follow the instructions in this Blogpost_.
Now, you can follow the steps of our tutorial from within your Linux VM.


Step 1: Installing Mambaforge
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First, please **open a terminal** or make sure you are logged into your Vagrant Linux VM.
Assuming that you have a 64-bit system, on Linux, download and install Miniconda 3 with

.. code:: console

    $ wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
    $ bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

On MacOS with x86_64 architecture, download and install with

.. code:: console

    $ curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
    $ bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

On MacOS with ARM/M1 architecture, download and install with

.. code:: console

    $ curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh
    $ bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh

When you are asked the question

.. code::

    Do you wish the installer to prepend the install location to PATH ...? [yes|no]

answer with **yes**.
Along with a minimal Python 3 environment, Mambaforge contains the package manager Mamba_.
After closing your current terminal and opening a **new terminal**, you can use the new ``conda`` command to install software packages and create isolated environments to, for example, use different versions of the same package.
We will later use Conda_ to create an isolated environment with all the required software for this tutorial.

Step 2: Preparing a working directory
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First, **create a new directory** ``snakemake-tutorial`` at a **place you can easily remember** and change into that directory in your terminal:

.. code:: console

    $ mkdir snakemake-tutorial
    $ cd snakemake-tutorial

If you use a Vagrant Linux VM from Windows as described above, create that directory under ``/vagrant/``, so that the contents are shared with your host system (you can then edit all files from within Windows with an editor that supports Unix line breaks).
Then, **change to the newly created directory**.
In this directory, we will later create an example workflow that illustrates the Snakemake syntax and execution environment.
First, we download some example data on which the workflow shall be executed:

.. code:: console

    $ wget https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-tutorial-data/archive/v5.24.1.tar.gz
    $ tar --wildcards -xf v5.24.1.tar.gz --strip 1 "*/data" "*/environment.yaml"

This will create a folder ``data`` and a file ``environment.yaml`` in the working directory.
If your tar command does not provide a ``--wildcards`` flag, you can also just unpack the file without it (which will just leave some more unneeded files in the working directory).

Step 3: Creating an environment with the required software
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First, make sure to activate the conda base environment with

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate base

The ``environment.yaml`` file that you have obtained with the previous step (Step 2) can be used to install all required software into an isolated Conda environment with the name ``snakemake-tutorial`` via

.. code:: console

    $ mamba env create --name snakemake-tutorial --file environment.yaml

If you don't have the Mamba_ command because you used a different conda distribution than Mambaforge_, you can also first install Mamba_ 
(which is a faster and more robust replacement for Conda_) in your base environment with

.. code:: console

    $ conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba

and then run the `mamba env create` command shown above.

Step 4: Activating the environment
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To activate the ``snakemake-tutorial`` environment, execute

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate snakemake-tutorial

Now you can use the installed tools.
Execute

.. code:: console

    $ snakemake --help

to test this and get information about the command-line interface of Snakemake.
To exit the environment, you can execute

.. code:: console

    $ conda deactivate

but **don't do that now**, since we finally want to start working with Snakemake :-).
