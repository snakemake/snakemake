The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create **reproducible and scalable** data analyses.
Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language.
They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.
Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.

Snakemake is **highly popular**, with `>10 new citations per week <https://badge.dimensions.ai/details/id/pub.1018944052>`_.
