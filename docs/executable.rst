===================
Executing Snakemake
===================

This part of the documentation describes the ``snakemake`` executable.  Snakemake
is primarily a command-line tool, so the ``snakemake`` executable is the primary way
to execute, debug, and visualize workflows.

.. user_manual-snakemake_options:

-----------------------------
Useful Command Line Arguments
-----------------------------

If called without parameters, i.e.

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake

Snakemake tries to execute the workflow specified in a file called ``Snakefile`` in the same directory (instead, the Snakefile can be given via the parameter ``-s``).

By issuing

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake -n

a dry-run can be performed.
This is useful to test if the workflow is defined properly and to estimate the amount of needed computation.
Further, the reason for each rule execution can be printed via


.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake -n -r

Importantly, Snakemake can automatically determine which parts of the workflow can be run in parallel.
By specifying the number of available cores, i.e.

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cores 4

one can tell Snakemake to use up to 4 cores and solve a binary knapsack problem to optimize the scheduling of jobs.
If the number is omitted (i.e., only ``--cores`` is given), the number of used cores is determined as the number of available CPU cores in the machine.

Dealing with very large workflows
---------------------------------

If your workflow has a lot of jobs, Snakemake might need some time to infer the dependencies (the job DAG) and which jobs are actually required to run.
The major bottleneck involved is the filesystem, which has to be queried for existence and modification dates of files.
To overcome this issue, Snakemake allows to run large workflows in batches.
This way, fewer files have to be evaluated at once, and therefore the job DAG can be inferred faster.
By running

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cores 4 --batch myrule=1/3

you instruct to only compute the first of three batches of the inputs of the rule `myrule`.
To generate the second batch, run

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cores 4 --batch myrule=2/3

Finally, when running


.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cores 4 --batch myrule=3/3

Snakemake will process beyond the rule `myrule`, because all of its input files have been generated, and complete the workflow.
Obviously, a good choice of the rule to perform the batching is a rule that has a lot of input files and upstream jobs, for example a central aggregation step within your workflow.
We advice all workflow developers to inform potential users of the best suited batching rule.


-------------
Cloud Support
-------------

Snakemake 4.0 and later supports execution in the cloud via Kubernetes.
This is independent of the cloud provider, but we provide the setup steps for GCE below.

Google cloud engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install the `Google Cloud SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts>`_.
Then, run

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud init

to setup your access.
Then, you can create a new kubernetes cluster via

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes=$NODES --scopes storage-rw

with ``$CLUSTER_NAME`` being the cluster name and ``$NODES`` being the number of cluster
nodes. If you intent to use google storage, make sure that `--scopes storage-rw` is set.
This enables Snakemake to write to the google storage from within the cloud nodes.
Next, you configure Kubernetes to use the new cluster via

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME


If you are having issues with authentication, please refer to the help text:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials --help

You likely also want to use google storage for reading and writing files.
For this, you will additionally need to authenticate with your google cloud account via

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud auth application-default login

This enables Snakemake to access google storage in order to check existence and modification dates of files.
Now, Snakemake is ready to use your cluster.

**Important:** After finishing your work, do not forget to delete the cluster with

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME

in order to avoid unnecessary charges.


.. _kubernetes:

Executing a Snakemake workflow via kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming that kubernetes has been properly configured (see above), you can
execute a workflow via:

.. code-block:: console

    snakemake --kubernetes --use-conda --default-remote-provider $REMOTE --default-remote-prefix $PREFIX

In this mode, Snakemake will assume all input and output files to be stored in a given
remote location, configured by setting ``$REMOTE`` to your provider of choice
(e.g. ``GS`` for Google cloud storage or ``S3`` for Amazon S3) and ``$PREFIX``
to a bucket name or subfolder within that remote storage.
After successful execution, you find your results in the specified remote storage.
Of course, if any input or output already defines a different remote location, the latter will be used instead.
Importantly, this means that Snakemake does **not** require a shared network
filesystem to work in the cloud.


.. sidebar:: Note

  Consider to :ref:`group jobs <snakefiles-grouping>` in order to minimize overhead, in particular for short-running jobs.

Currently, this mode requires that the Snakemake workflow is stored in a git repository.
Snakemake uses git to query necessary source files (the Snakefile, scripts, config, ...)
for workflow execution and encodes them into the kubernetes job.

It is further possible to forward arbitrary environment variables to the kubernetes
jobs via the flag ``--kubernetes-env`` (see ``snakemake --help``).

When executing, Snakemake will make use of the defined resources and threads
to schedule jobs to the correct nodes. In particular, it will forward memory requirements
defined as `mem_mb` to kubernetes. Further, it will propagate the number of threads
a job intends to use, such that kubernetes can allocate it to the correct cloud
computing node.


Executing a Snakemake workflow via Tibanna on Amazon Web Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install `Tibanna <https://tibanna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U tibanna


Set up aws configuration either by creating files ``~/.aws/credentials`` and ``~/.aws/config`` 
or by setting up environment variables as below (see Tibanna or AWS documentation for more details):

.. code-block:: console

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    $ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>


As an AWS admin, deploy Tibanna Unicorn to Cloud with permissions to a specific S3 bucket.
Name the Unicorn / Unicorn usergroup with the ``--usergroup`` option.
Unicorn is a serverless scheduler, and keeping unicorn on the cloud does not incur extra cost. 
One may have many different unicorns with different names and different bucket permissions.
Then, add other (IAM) users to the user group that has permission to use this unicorn / buckets.

.. code-block:: console

    $ tibanna deploy_unicorn -g <name> -b <bucket>
    $ tibanna add_user -u <username> -g <name>


As a user that has been added to the group (or as an admin), set up the default unicorn.

.. code-block:: console

    $ export TIBANNA_DEFAULT_STEP_FUNCTION_NAME=tibanna_unicorn_<name>


Then, you can run as many snakemake runs as you wish as below, inside a directory that contains
Snakefile and other necessary components (e.g. ``env.yml``, ``config.json``, ...).

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --tibanna --default-remote-prefix=<bucketname>/<subdir> [<other options>]


In this mode, Snakemake will assume all input and output files to be stored in the specified remote location
(a subdirectory inside a given S3 bucket.)
After successful execution, you find your results in the specified remote storage.
Of course, if any input or output already defines a different remote location, the latter will be used instead.
In that case, Tibanna Unicorn must be deployed with all the relevant buckets (``-b bucket1,bucket2,bucket3,...``)
to allow access to the Unicorn serverless components.
Snakemake will assign 3x of the total input size as the allocated space for each execution. The execution may fail
if the total input + output + temp file sizes exceed this estimate.

In addition to regular snakemake options, ``--precommand=<command>`` option allows sending a command to execute before
executing each step on an isolated environment. This kind of command could involve downloading or installing
necessary files that cannot be handled using conda (e.g. the command may begin with ``wget``, ``git clone``, etc.) 


To check Tibanna execution logs, first use ``tibanna stat`` to see the list of all the individual runs.

.. code-block:: console

    $ tibanna stat -n <number_of_executions_to_view> -l


Then, check the detailed log for each job using the Tibanna job id that can be obtained from the first column
of the output of ``tibanna stat``.


.. code-block:: console

    $ tibanna log -j <jobid>


.. sidebar:: Note

  Consider to :ref:`group jobs <snakefiles-grouping>` in order to minimize overhead, in particular for short-running jobs.


When executing, Snakemake will make use of the defined resources and threads
to schedule jobs to the correct nodes. In particular, it will forward memory requirements
defined as `mem_mb` to Tibanna. Further, it will propagate the number of threads
a job intends to use, such that Tibanna can allocate it to the most cost-effective
cloud compute instance available.


-----------------
Cluster Execution
-----------------


Snakemake can make use of cluster engines that support shell scripts and have access to a common filesystem, (e.g. the Sun Grid Engine).
In this case, Snakemake simply needs to be given a submit command that accepts a shell script as first positional argument:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster qsub -j 32


Here, ``-j`` denotes the number of jobs submitted being submitted to the cluster at the same time (here 32).
The cluster command can be decorated with job specific information, e.g.

.. sidebar:: Note

  Consider to :ref:`group jobs <snakefiles-grouping>` in order to minimize overhead, in particular for short-running jobs.


.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub {threads}"

Thereby, all keywords of a rule are allowed (e.g. rulename, params, input, output, threads, priority, ...).
For example, you could encode the expected running time into params:

.. code-block:: python

    rule:
        input:  ...
        output: ...
        params: runtime="4h"
        shell: ...

and forward it to the cluster scheduler:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --cluster "qsub --runtime {params.runtime}"

If your cluster system supports `DRMAA <http://www.drmaa.org/>`_, Snakemake can make use of that to increase the control over jobs.
E.g. jobs can be cancelled upon pressing ``Ctrl+C``, which is not possible with the generic ``--cluster`` support.
With DRMAA, no ``qsub`` command needs to be provided, but system specific arguments can still be given as a string, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --drmaa " -q username" -j 32

Note that the string has to contain a leading whitespace.
Else, the arguments will be interpreted as part of the normal Snakemake arguments, and execution will fail.


Job Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When executing a workflow on a cluster using the ``--cluster`` parameter (see below), Snakemake creates a job script for each job to execute. This script is then invoked using the provided cluster submission command (e.g. ``qsub``). Sometimes you want to provide a custom wrapper for the cluster submission command that decides about additional parameters. As this might be based on properties of the job, Snakemake stores the job properties (e.g. name, rulename, threads, input, output, params etc.) as JSON inside the job script (for group jobs, the rulename will be "GROUP", otherwise it will be the same as the job name). For convenience, there exists a parser function `snakemake.utils.read_job_properties` that can be used to access the properties. The following shows an example job submission wrapper:

.. code-block:: python

    #!python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import os
    import sys

    from snakemake.utils import read_job_properties

    jobscript = sys.argv[1]
    job_properties = read_job_properties(jobscript)

    # do something useful with the threads
    threads = job_properties[threads]

    # access property defined in the cluster configuration file (Snakemake >=3.6.0)
    job_properties["cluster"]["time"]

    os.system("qsub -t {threads} {script}".format(threads=threads, script=jobscript))


.. _profiles:

--------
Profiles
--------

Adapting Snakemake to a particular environment can entail many flags and options.
Therefore, since Snakemake 4.1, it is possible to specify a configuration profile
to be used to obtain default options:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snakemake --profile myprofile

Here, a folder ``myprofile`` is searched in per-user and global configuration directories (on Linux, this will be ``$HOME/.config/snakemake`` and ``/etc/xdg/snakemake``, you can find the answer for your system via ``snakemake --help``).
Alternatively, an absolute or relative path to the folder can be given.
The profile folder is expected to contain a file ``config.yaml`` that defines default values for the Snakemake command line arguments.
For example, the file

.. code-block:: yaml

    cluster: qsub
    jobs: 100

would setup Snakemake to always submit to the cluster via the ``qsub`` command, and never use more than 100 parallel jobs in total.
Under https://github.com/snakemake-profiles/doc, you can find publicly available profiles.
Feel free to contribute your own.

The profile folder can additionally contain auxilliary files, e.g., jobscripts, or any kind of wrappers.
See https://github.com/snakemake-profiles/doc for examples.

.. _getting_started-visualization:

-------------
Visualization
-------------

To visualize the workflow, one can use the option ``--dag``.
This creates a representation of the DAG in the graphviz dot language which has to be postprocessed by the graphviz tool ``dot``.
E.g. to visualize the DAG that would be executed, you can issue:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --dag | dot | display

For saving this to a file, you can specify the desired format:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --dag | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf

To visualize the whole DAG regardless of the eventual presence of files, the ``forceall`` option can be used:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --forceall --dag | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf

Of course the visual appearance can be modified by providing further command line arguments to ``dot``.


.. _cwl_export:

----------
CWL export
----------

Snakemake workflows can be exported to `CWL <http://www.commonwl.org/>`_, such that they can be executed in any `CWL-enabled workflow engine <https://www.commonwl.org/#Implementations>`_.
Since, CWL is less powerful for expressing workflows than Snakemake (most importantly Snakemake offers more flexible scatter-gather patterns, since full Python can be used), export works such that every Snakemake job is encoded into a single step in the CWL workflow.
Moreover, every step of that workflow calls Snakemake again to execute the job. The latter enables advanced Snakemake features like scripts, benchmarks and remote files to work inside CWL.
So, when exporting keep in mind that the resulting CWL file can become huge, depending on the number of jobs in your workflow.
To export a Snakemake workflow to CWL, simply run

.. code-block:: console

    $ snakemake --export-cwl workflow.cwl

The resulting workflow will by default use the `Snakemake docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/snakemake/snakemake>`_ for every step, but this behavior can be overwritten via the CWL execution environment.
Then, the workflow can be executed in the same working directory with, e.g.,

.. code-block:: console

    $ cwltool workflow.cwl

Note that due to limitations in CWL, it seems currently impossible to avoid that all target files (output files of target jobs), are written directly to the workdir, regardless of their relative paths in the Snakefile.

Note that export is impossible in case the workflow contains :ref:`dynamic output files <snakefiles-dynamic_files>` or output files with absolute paths.

.. _all_options:

-----------
All Options
-----------

.. argparse::
   :module: snakemake
   :func: get_argument_parser
   :prog: snakemake

   All command line options can be printed by calling ``snakemake -h``.

.. _getting_started-bash_completion:

---------------
Bash Completion
---------------

Snakemake supports bash completion for filenames, rulenames and arguments.
To enable it globally, just append

.. code-block:: bash

    `snakemake --bash-completion`

including the accents to your ``.bashrc``.
This only works if the ``snakemake`` command is in your path.
