### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

Snakemake 8 marks the beginning of decomposing Snakemake into a framework of plugins. This enables the democratization of method development within the Snakemake ecosystem.
We start with plugins for storage and execution backends. In the future, there will be plugins for the scheduling, metadata, software deployment, reporting, and many more.
This way, it will be possible to easily launch and explore new developments in workflow management and reproducible data analysis without the need to get your work merged into the main codebase of Snakemake and also without the need to develop a new workflow management system as a proof of concept.

In detail, Snakemake 8 introduces the following changes. Unfortunately it was unavoidable to break some usages (we apologize).
Nevertheless, we tried to ensure that every removed or modified feature has been replaced with an equivalent reimplementation, as outlined in our [migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8).
While Snakemake 8 has an even more thorough testing framework than any release before, and while it has been quite heavily tested in practice by us, you might initially experience bugs and glitches for which we want to apologize beforehand.
We think that the massive codebase improvements are worth it in the long run, and hope that everything goes well.
As always, any pull requests with test cases and pointers to bugs are more than welcome.

#### Detailed breaking changes

* removed the long time ago deprecated support for dynamic, version, and subworkflow (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))
* migrated old remote providers into storage plugins (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))
* migrated execution backends into plugins, including a change in the respective command line interfaces (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))
* deprecates `--use-conda` and `--use-singularity` in favor of `--software-deployment-method conda` or `--software-deployment-method apptainer` and `--software-deployment-method conda apptainer` (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))
* profile support is now versioned, such that different profiles can be written for different minimum Snakemake versions (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))
* redesigned Snakemake API. It now uses a modern, dataclass based approach (see [the migration docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/migration.html#migrating-to-snakemake-8))

    If files are present, the overhead is minimal, since the checks for
    the parents are cached.
-   Various minor bug fixes.

## \[4.8.0\] - 2018-03-13

#### Added

-   Integration with CWL: the `cwl` directive allows to use CWL tool

    singularity container to be used for all rules that don't specify
    their own.
-   Singularity and Conda can now be combined. This can be used to
    specify the operating system (via singularity), and the software
    stack (via conda), without the overhead of creating specialized
    container images for workflows or tasks.

## \[4.7.0\] - 2018-02-19

#### Changed

-   Speedups when calculating dry-runs.
-   Speedups for workflows with many rules when calculating the DAG.

-   A new shadow mode (minimal) that only symlinks input files has been
    added.

#### Changed

-   The default shell is now bash on linux and macOS. If bash is not
    installed, we fall back to sh. Previously, Snakemake used the
    default shell of the user, which defeats the purpose of portability.
    If the developer decides so, the shell can be always overwritten
    using shell.executable().
-   Snakemake now requires Singularity 2.4.1 at least (only when running
    with --use-singularity).
-   HTTP remote provider no longer automatically unpacks gzipped files.

    Changed
-   Scheduling and execution mechanisms have undergone a major revision
    that removes several potential (but rare) deadlocks.
-   Several bugs and corner cases of the singularity support have been
    fixed.
-   Snakemake now requires singularity 2.4 at least.

## \[4.2.0\] - 2017-10-10

## \[4.1.0\] - 2017-09-26

#### Added

-   Support for configuration profiles. Profiles allow to specify
    default options, e.g., a cluster submission command. They can be
    used via 'snakemake --profile myprofile'. See the docs for details.
-   GFAL remote provider. This allows to use GridFTP, SRM and any other
    protocol supported by GFAL for remote input and output files.
-   Added --cluster-status flag that allows to specify a command that
    returns jobs status. # ## Changed
-   The scheduler now tries to get rid of the largest temp files first.
-   The Docker image used for kubernetes support can now be configured
    at the command line.
-   Rate-limiting for cluster interaction has been unified.
-   S3 remote provider uses boto3.
-   Resource functions can now use an additional `attempt` parameter,
    that contains the number of times this job has already been tried.
-   Various minor fixes.

## \[4.0.0\] - 2017-07-24

#### Added

-   Cloud computing support via Kubernetes. Snakemake workflows can be
    executed transparently in the cloud, while storing input and output
    files within the cloud storage (e.g. S3 or Google Storage). I.e.,
    this feature does not need a shared filesystem between the cloud
    notes, and thereby makes the setup really simple.
-   WebDAV remote file support: Snakemake can now read and write from
    WebDAV. Hence, it can now, e.g., interact with Nextcloud or
    Owncloud.
-   Support for default remote providers: define a remote provider to
    implicitly use for all input and output files.
-   Added an option to only create conda environments instead of
    executing the workflow. # ## Changed
-   The number of files used for the metadata tracking of Snakemake
    (e.g., code, params, input changes) in the .snakemake directory has
    been reduced by a factor of 10, which should help with NFS and IO
    bottlenecks. This is a breaking change in the sense that Snakemake
    4.x won't see the metadata of workflows executed with Snakemake 3.x.
    However, old metadata won't be overwritten, so that you can always
    go back and check things by installing an older version of Snakemake
    again.
-   The google storage (GS) remote provider has been changed to use the
    google SDK. This is a breaking change, since the remote provider
    invocation has been simplified (see docs).
-   Due to WebDAV support (which uses asyncio), Snakemake now requires
    Python 3.5 at least.
-   Various minor bug fixes (e.g. for dynamic output files).

### \[3.13.3\] - 2017-06-23

#### Changed

-   Fix a followup bug in Namedlist where a single item was not returned
    as string.

### \[3.13.2\] - 2017-06-20

#### Changed

-   The --wrapper-prefix flag now also affects where the corresponding
    environment definition is fetched from.
-   Fix bug where empty output file list was recognized as containing
    duplicates (issue #574).

### \[3.13.1\] - 2017-06-20

#### Changed

-   Fix --conda-prefix to be passed to all jobs.
-   Fix cleanup issue with scripts that fail to download.

## \[3.13.0\] - 2017-06-12

#### Added

-   An NCBI remote provider. By this, you can seamlessly integrate any
    NCBI resource (reference genome, gene/protein sequences, ...) as
    input file. # ## Changed
-   Snakemake now detects if automatically generated conda environments
    have to be recreated because the workflow has been moved to a new
    path.
-   Remote functionality has been made more robust, in particular to
    avoid race conditions.
-   `--config` parameter evaluation has been fixed for non-string types.
-   The Snakemake docker container is now based on the official debian
    image.

## \[3.12.0\] - 2017-05-09

#### Added

-   Support for RMarkdown (.Rmd) in script directives.
-   New option --debug-dag that prints all decisions while building the
    DAG of jobs. This helps to debug problems like cycles or unexpected
    MissingInputExceptions.
-   New option --conda-prefix to specify the place where conda
    environments are stored.

#### Changed

-   Benchmark files now also include the maximal RSS and VMS size of the
    Snakemake process and all sub processes.
-   Speedup conda environment creation.
-   Allow specification of DRMAA log dir.

    wildcards, output: ...)
-   Improved conda-environment creation.
-   Jobs are cached, leading to reduced memory footprint.
-   Fixed subworkflow handling in input functions.

## \[3.10.0\] - 2017-01-18

#### Added

-   Workflows can now be archived to a tarball with
    `snakemake --archive my-workflow.tar.gz`. The archive contains all
    input files, source code versioned with git and all software
    packages that are defined via conda environments. Hence, the archive
    allows to fully reproduce a workflow on a different machine. Such an
    archive can be uploaded to Zenodo, such that your workflow is
    secured in a self-contained, executable way for the future. # ##
    Changed
-   Improved logging.
-   Reduced memory footprint.
-   Added a flag to automatically unpack the output of input functions.
-   Improved handling of HTTP redirects with remote files.
-   Improved exception handling with DRMAA.

-   Various bug fixes.

## \[3.9.0\] - 2016-11-15

#### Added

-   Ability to define isolated conda software environments (YAML) per
    rule. Environments will be deployed by Snakemake upon workflow
    execution.
-   Command line argument --wrapper-prefix in order to overwrite the
    default URL for looking up wrapper scripts. # ## Changed
-   --summary now displays the log files corresponding to each output
    file.
-   Fixed hangups when using run directive and a large number of jobs
-   Fixed pickling errors with anonymous rules and run directive.
-   Various small bug fixes

### \[3.8.2\] - 2016-09-23

#### Changed

-   Add missing import in rules.py.
-   Use threading only in cluster jobs.

### \[3.8.1\] - 2016-09-14

#### Changed

-   Snakemake now warns when using relative paths starting with "./".
-   The option -R now also accepts an empty list of arguments.
-   Bug fix when handling benchmark directive.
-   Jobscripts exit with code 1 in case of failure. This should improve
    the error messages of cluster system.
-   Fixed a bug in SFTP remote provider.

## \[3.8.0\] - 2016-08-26

#### Added

-   Wildcards can now be constrained by rule and globally via the new
    `wildcard_constraints` directive (see the
    [docs](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-wildcards)).
-   Subworkflows now allow to overwrite their config file via the
    configfile directive in the calling Snakefile.
-   A method `log_fmt_shell` in the snakemake proxy object that is
    available in scripts and wrappers allows to obtain a formatted
    string to redirect logging output from STDOUT or STDERR.
-   Functions given to resources can now optionally contain an
    additional argument `input` that refers to the input files.
-   Functions given to params can now optionally contain additional
    arguments `input` (see above) and `resources`. The latter refers to
    the resources.
-   It is now possible to let items in shell commands be automatically
    quoted (see the
    [docs](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-rules)).
    This is useful when dealing with filenames that contain
    whitespaces.

#### Changed

-   Snakemake now deletes output files before job execution. Further, it
    touches output files after job execution. This solves various
    problems with slow NFS filesystems.
-   A bug was fixed that caused dynamic output rules to be executed
    multiple times when forcing their execution with -R.
-   A bug causing double uploads with remote files was fixed. Various
    additional bug fixes related to remote files.
-   Various minor bug fixes.

### \[3.7.1\] - 2016-05-16

#### Changed

-   Fixed a missing import of the multiprocessing module.

## \[3.7.0\] - 2016-05-05

#### Added

-   The entries in `resources` and the `threads` job attribute can now
    be callables that must return `int` values.
-   Multiple `--cluster-config` arguments can be given to the Snakemake
    command line. Later one override earlier ones.
-   In the API, multiple `cluster_config` paths can be given as a list,
    alternatively to the previous behaviour of expecting one string for
    this parameter.
-   When submitting cluster jobs (either through `--cluster` or
    `--drmaa`), you can now use `--max-jobs-per-second` to limit the
    number of jobs being submitted (also available through Snakemake
    API). Some cluster installations have problems with too many jobs
    per second.
-   Wildcard values are now printed upon job execution in addition to
    input and output files. # ## Changed
-   Fixed a bug with HTTP remote providers.

### \[3.6.1\] - 2016-04-08

#### Changed

-   Work around missing RecursionError in Python \< 3.5
-   Improved conversion of numpy and pandas data structures to R
    scripts.
-   Fixed locking of working directory.

## \[3.6.0\] - 2016-03-10

#### Added

-   onstart handler, that allows to add code that shall be only executed
    before the actual workflow execution (not on dryrun).
-   Parameters defined in the cluster config file are now accessible in
    the job properties under the key "cluster".
-   The wrapper directive can be considered stable. # ## Changed
-   Allow to use rule/job parameters with braces notation in cluster
    config.
-   Show a proper error message in case of recursion errors.

    signals from parent processes to be propagated.
-   Fixed various corner case bugs.
-   The params directive no longer converts a list `l` implicitly to
    `" ".join(l)`.

### \[3.5.5\] - 2016-01-23

#### Added

-   New experimental wrapper directive, which allows to refer to
    reusable [wrapper
    scripts](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-wrappers).
    Wrappers are provided in the [Snakemake Wrapper
    Repository](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers).
-   David Koppstein implemented two new command line options to
    constrain the execution of the DAG of job to sub-DAGs (--until and
    --omit-from). # ## Changed
-   Fixed various bugs, e.g. with shadow jobs and --latency-wait.

### \[3.5.4\] - 2015-12-04

#### Changed

-   The params directive now fully supports non-string parameters.
    Several bugs in the remote support were fixed.

### \[3.5.3\] - 2015-11-24

#### Changed

-   The missing remote module was added to the package.

### \[3.5.2\] - 2015-11-24

#### Added

-   Support for easy integration of external R and Python scripts via
    the new [script
    directive](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-external-scripts).
-   Chris Tomkins-Tinch has implemented support for remote files:
    Snakemake can now handle input and output files from Amazon S3,
    Google Storage, FTP, SFTP, HTTP and Dropbox.
-   Simon Ye has implemented support for sandboxing jobs with [shadow
    rules](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-shadow-rules).

#### Changed

-   Manuel Holtgrewe has fixed dynamic output files in combination with
    multiple wildcards.
-   It is now possible to add suffixes to all shell commands with
    shell.suffix("mysuffix").
-   Job execution has been refactored to spawn processes only when
    necessary, resolving several problems in combination with huge
    workflows consisting of thousands of jobs and reducing the memory
    footprint.
-   In order to reflect the new collaborative development model,
    Snakemake has moved from my personal bitbucket account to
    <http://snakemake.bitbucket.org>.

### \[3.4.2\] - 2015-09-12

#### Changed

-   Willem Ligtenberg has reduced the memory usage of Snakemake.
-   Per Unneberg has improved config file handling to provide a more
    intuitive overwrite behavior.
-   Simon Ye has improved the test suite of Snakemake and helped with
    setting up continuous integration via Codeship.
-   The cluster implementation has been rewritten to use only a single
    thread to wait for jobs. This avoids failures with large numbers of
    jobs.
-   Benchmarks are now writing tab-delimited text files instead of JSON.
-   Snakemake now always requires to set the number of jobs with -j when
    in cluster mode. Set this to a high value if your cluster does not
    have restrictions.
-   The Snakemake Conda package has been moved to the bioconda channel.
-   The handling of Symlinks was improved, which made a switch to Python
    3.3 as the minimum required Python version necessary.

### \[3.4.1\] - 2015-08-05

#### Changed

-   This release fixes a bug that caused named input or output files to
    always be returned as lists instead of single files.

## \[3.4\] - 2015-07-18

#### Added

-   This release adds support for executing jobs on clusters in
    synchronous mode (e.g. qsub -sync). Thanks to David Alexander for
    implementing this.
-   There is now vim syntax highlighting support (thanks to Jay
    Hesselberth).
-   Snakemake is now available as Conda package.

#### Changed

-   Lots of bugs have been fixed. Thanks go to e.g. David Koppstein,
    Marcel Martin, John Huddleston and Tao Wen for helping with useful
    reports and debugging.
