    @classmethod
    def basic_layered(
        cls,
        toposorted_jobs,

    ):
        """Basic implementation of group job resources calculation

        Each toposort level is individually sorted into a series of layers, where each
        layer fits within the constraints. Resource constraints represent a "width" into
        which the layer must fit. For instance, with a mem_mb constraint of 5G, all the
        jobs in a single layer must together not consume more than 5G of memory. Any
        jobs that would exceed this constraint are pushed into a new layer. The overall
        width for the entire group job is equal to the width of the widest layer.

        Additive resources (by default, "runtime") represent the "height" of the layer.
        They are not directly constrained, but their value will be determined by the
        sorting of jobs based on other constraints. Each layer's height is equal to the
        height of its tallest job. For instance, a layer containing a 3hr job will have
        a runtime height of 3 hr. The total height of the entire group job will be the
        sum of the heights of all the layers.

        Note that both height and width are multidimensial, so layer widths will be
        calculated with respect to every constraint created by the user.

        In this implementation, there is no mixing of layers, which may lead to "voids".
        For instance, a layer containing a tall, skinny job of 3hr length and 1G mem
        combined with a short, fat job of 10min length and 20G memory would have a 2hr
        50min period where 19G of memory are not used. In practice, this void will be
        filled by the actual snakemake subprocess, which performs real-time scheduling
        of jobs as resources become available.  But it may lead to overestimation of
        resource requirements.

        To help mitigate against voids, this implementation sorts the jobs within a
        toposort level before assignment to layers. Jobs are first sorted by their
        overall width relative to the available constraints. So the fattest jobs will
        grouped together on the same layer. Jobs are then sorted by the resources
        specified in ``sortby``, by default "runtime". So jobs of similar length will be
        grouped on the same layer.

        Users can help mitigate against voids by grouping jobs of similar resource
        dimensions.  Eclectic groups of various runtimes and resource consumptions will
        not be estimated as efficiently as groups of homogenous consumptions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        toposorted_jobs : list of lists of jobs
            Jobs sorted into toposort levels: the jobs in each level only depend on jobs
            in previous levels.
        constraints : dict of str -> int
            Upper limit of resource allowed. Resources without constraints will be
            treated as infinite
        run_local : bool
            True if the group is being run in the local process, rather than being
            submitted. Relevant for Pipe groups and Service groups
        additive_resources : list of str, optional
            Resources to be treated as the "height" of each layer, i.e. to be summed
            across layers.
        sortby : list of str, optional
            Resources by which to sort jobs prior to layer assignment.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict of str -> int,str
            Total resource requirements of the group job
