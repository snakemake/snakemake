# Snakemake

The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create **reproducible and scalable** data analyses.
Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language.
They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments without the need to modify the workflow definition.
Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.

**Note: Snakemake has just (Oct 4 2019) moved from bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake to Github. Forks and stars are not yet insightful here!**
