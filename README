Snakemake -- a pythonic workflow system

Build systems like GNU Make are frequently used to create complicated workflows, 
e.g. in bioinformatics. This project aims to reduce the complexity of creating 
workflows by providing a clean and modern domain specific specification language (DSL) 
in python style, together with a fast and comfortable execution environment.
